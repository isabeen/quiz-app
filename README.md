# Project: Quiz App - Layout

In this project I'll build the layout of my first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later
projects I will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality. In this app you will be
able to:

- Read questions and click buttons to look up the answers.
- Bookmark questions and view them on a bookmarks page.
- Visit your profile page.
